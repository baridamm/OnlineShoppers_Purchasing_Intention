# OnlineShoppers_Purchasing_Intention
Machine Learning Final Project

The goal of the project is to predict if online shoppers end up shopping after each session, based on different session predictors. The problem is classified by two determining factors, Positive- if the shopper ends up shopping and Negative- if they do not.

The online shoppers purchasing intention classification dataset contains the information of each session the shopper visits online, based on which a prediction is made whether a person is shopped/ not shopped. We use 3 models to classify the observations. First, we propose a baseline model and then implement logistic regression, na√Øve bayes and neural networks to classify the results.
